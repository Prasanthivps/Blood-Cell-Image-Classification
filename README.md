# Blood-Cell-Image-Classification
It is well known that we can detect and classify diseases using the blood cells. Here we use different algorithms to process the data which the images of blood cells thereby we analyze it and generate the result(disease) accordingly by using classification techniques like RNN, CNN, SVM etc. So, by using ML techniques we can detect the disease by using neural networks with image classification. These results reveal that comparison between other Convolutional neural network our proposed neural network model is more efficient and accurate in classifying blood cell images. Based on the significance of blood cell classification in the diagnosis, researchers have proposed many algorithms to classify blood cells.
